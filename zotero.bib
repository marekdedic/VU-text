	abstract = {Multiple-instance problems arise from the situations where training class labels are attached to sets of samples (named bags), instead of individual samples within each bag (called instances). Most previous multiple-instance learning ({MIL}) algorithms are developed based on the assumption that a bag is positive if and only if at least one of its instances is positive. Although the assumption works well in a drug activity prediction problem, it is rather restrictive for other applications, especially those in the computer vision area. We propose a learning method, {MILES} (multiple-instance learning via embedded instance selection), which converts the multiple-instance learning problem to a standard supervised learning problem that does not impose the assumption relating instance labels to bag labels. {MILES} maps each bag into a feature space defined by the instances in the training bags via an instance similarity measure. This feature mapping often provides a large number of redundant or irrelevant features. Hence, 1-norm {SVM} is applied to select important features as well as construct classifiers simultaneously. We have performed extensive experiments. In comparison with other methods, {MILES} demonstrates competitive classification accuracy, high computation efficiency, and robustness to labeling uncertainty},

	url = {http://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/handle/10289/2460},
	abstract = {Multi-instance ({MI}) learning is a variant of supervised machine learning, where each learning example contains a bag of instances instead of just a single feature vector. {MI} learning has applications in areas such as drug activity prediction, fruit disease management and image classification.

This thesis investigates the case where each instance has a weight value determining the level of influence that it has on its bag's class label. This is a more general assumption than most existing approaches use, and thus is more widely applicable. The challenge is to accurately estimate these weights in order to make predictions at the bag level.

An existing approach known as {MILES} is retroactively identified as an algorithm that uses instance weights for {MI} learning, and is evaluated using a variety of base learners on benchmark problems. New algorithms for learning instance weights for {MI} learning are also proposed and rigorously evaluated on both artificial and real-world datasets. The new algorithms are shown to achieve better root mean squared error rates than existing approaches on artificial data generated according to the algorithms' underlying assumptions. Experimental results also demonstrate that the new algorithms are competitive with existing approaches on real-world problems.},

The instances in a bag, however, are rarely independent in real tasks, and a better performance can be expected if the instances are treated in an non-i.i.d. way that exploits relations among instances. In this paper, we propose two simple yet effective methods. In the first method, we explicitly map every bag to an undirected graph and design a graph kernel for distinguishing the positive and negative bags. In the second method, we implicitly construct graphs by deriving affinity matrices and propose an efficient graph kernel considering the clique information. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are validated by experiments.},

	abstract = {Multiple instance learning ({MIL}) is concerned with learning from sets (bags) of objects (instances), where the individual instance labels are ambiguous. In this setting, supervised learning cannot be applied directly. Often, specialized {MIL} methods learn by making additional assumptions about the relationship of the bag labels and instance labels. Such assumptions may fit a particular dataset, but do not generalize to the whole range of {MIL} problems. Other {MIL} methods shift the focus of assumptions from the labels to the overall (dis)similarity of bags, and therefore learn from bags directly. We propose to represent each bag by a vector of its dissimilarities to other bags in the training set, and treat these dissimilarities as a feature representation. We show several alternatives to define a dissimilarity between bags and discuss which definitions are more suitable for particular {MIL} problems. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is computationally inexpensive, yet very competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms on a wide range of {MIL} datasets.},

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.  Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

In this work we provide such an analysis focused on the classification task (i.e., leaving out other learning tasks such as regression). In order to perform our study, we implemented fourteen methods grouped into three different families. We analyze the performance of the approaches across a variety of well-known databases, and we also study their behavior in synthetic scenarios in order to highlight their characteristics. As a result of this analysis, we conclude that methods that extract global bag-level information show a clearly superior performance in general. In this sense, the analysis permits us to understand why some types of methods are more successful than others, and it permits us to establish guidelines in the design of new {MIL} methods.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss {AdaMax}, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	abstract = {Modelling network traffic is gaining importance to counter modern security threats of ever increasing sophistication. It is though surprisingly difficult and costly to construct reliable classifiers on top of telemetry data due to the variety and complexity of signals that no human can manage to interpret in full. Obtaining training data with sufficiently large and variable body of labels can thus be seen as a prohibitive problem. The goal of this work is to detect infected computers by observing their {HTTP}(S) traffic collected from network sensors, which are typically proxy servers or network firewalls, while relying on only minimal human input in the model training phase. We propose a discriminative model that makes decisions based on a computer's all traffic observed during a predefined time window (5 minutes in our case). The model is trained on traffic samples collected over equally-sized time windows for a large number of computers, where the only labels needed are (human) verdicts about the computer as a whole (presumed infected vs. presumed clean). As part of training, the model itself learns discriminative patterns in traffic targeted to individual servers and constructs the final high-level classifier on top of them. We show the classifier to perform with very high precision, and demonstrate that the learned traffic patterns can be interpreted as Indicators of Compromise. We implement the discriminative model as a neural network with special structure reflecting two stacked multi instance problems. The main advantages of the proposed configuration include not only improved accuracy and ability to learn from gross labels, but also automatic learning of server types (together with their detectors) that are typically visited by infected computers.},

But early works in the field have shown that the number of threshold functions (or linearly separable functions) in N binary variables is small compared to the number of all possible boolean mappings in N variables, especially if N is large. This problem is one of the main limitations of most neural networks models where the state is fully specified by the environment during learning: they can only learn linearly separable functions of their inputs. Moreover, a learning procedure which requires the outside world to specify the state of every neuron during the learning session can hardly be considered as a general learning rule because in real-world conditions, only a partial information on the “ideal” network state for each task is available from the environment. It is possible to use a set of so-called “hidden units” [Hinton,Sejnowski,Ackley. 84], without direct interaction with the environment, which can compute intermediate predicates. Unfortunately, the global response depends on the output of a particular hidden unit in a highly non-linear way, moreover the nature of this dependence is influenced by the states of the other cells.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7906},
	abstract = {We propose to exploit \{{\textbackslash}em reconstruction\} as a layer-local training signal for deep learning. Reconstructions can be propagated in a form of target propagation playing a role similar to back-propagation but helping to reduce the reliance on derivatives in order to perform credit assignment across many levels of possibly strong non-linearities (which is difficult for back-propagation). A regularized auto-encoder tends produce a reconstruction that is a more likely version of its input, i.e., a small move in the direction of higher likelihood. By generalizing gradients, target propagation may also allow to train deep networks with discrete hidden units. If the auto-encoder takes both a representation of input and target (or of any side information) in input, then its reconstruction of input representation provides a target towards a representation that is more likely, conditioned on all the side information. A deep auto-encoder decoding path generalizes gradient propagation in a learned way that can could thus handle not just infinitesimal changes but larger, discrete changes, hopefully allowing credit assignment through a long chain of non-linear operations. In addition to each layer being a good auto-encoder, the encoder also learns to please the upper layers by transforming the data into a space where it is easier to model by them, flattening manifolds and disentangling factors. The motivations and theoretical justifications for this approach are laid down in this paper, along with conjectures that will have to be verified either mathematically or experimentally, including a hypothesis stating that such auto-encoder mediated target propagation could play in brains the role of credit assignment through many non-linear, noisy and discrete transformations.},

	abstract = {Neuroscientists have long criticised deep learning algorithms as incompatible with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) arises out of a simple update rule that makes a lot of sense from a machine learning point of view and can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational {EM} algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks.},

	abstract = {Back-propagation has been the workhorse of recent successes of deep learning but it relies on infinitesimal effects (partial derivatives) in order to perform credit assignment. This could become a serious issue as one considers deeper and more non-linear functions, e.g., consider the extreme case of non-linearity where the relation between parameters and cost is actually discrete. Inspired by the biological implausibility of back-propagation, a few approaches have been proposed in the past that could play a similar credit assignment role. In this spirit, we explore a novel approach to credit assignment in deep networks that we call target propagation. The main idea is to compute targets rather than gradients, at each layer. Like gradients, they are propagated backwards. In a way that is related but different from previously proposed proxies for back-propagation which rely on a backwards network with symmetric weights, target propagation relies on auto-encoders at each layer. Unlike back-propagation, it can be applied even when units exchange stochastic bits rather than real numbers. We show that a linear correction for the imperfectness of the auto-encoders, called difference target propagation, is very effective to make target propagation actually work, leading to results comparable to back-propagation for deep networks with discrete and continuous units and denoising auto-encoders and achieving state of the art for stochastic networks.},

This approach appears thus as an efficient alternative to the general error back-propagation algorithm commonly used for training multilayer perceptrons.

Previous works in this area only concern multi-instance prediction problems where each bag is associated with a binary (classification) or real-valued (regression) label. However, unsupervised multi-instance learning where bags are without labels has not been studied. In this paper, the problem of unsupervised multi-instance learning is addressed where a multi-instance clustering algorithm named Bamic is proposed. Briefly, by regarding bags as atomic data items and using some form of distance metric to measure distances between bags, Bamic adapts the popular k -Medoids algorithm to partition the unlabeled training bags into k disjoint groups of bags. Furthermore, based on the clustering results, a novel multi-instance prediction algorithm named Bartmip is developed. Firstly, each bag is re-represented by a k-dimensional feature vector, where the value of the i-th feature is set to be the distance between the bag and the medoid of the i-th group. After that, bags are transformed into feature vectors so that common supervised learners are used to learn from the transformed feature vectors each associated with the original bag’s label. Extensive experiments show that Bamic could effectively discover the underlying structure of the data set and Bartmip works quite well on various kinds of multi-instance prediction problems.},

Many standard tools including supervised classifiers have been already adapted to {MIL} setting since the problem got formalized in the late nineties. In this work we propose a neural network ({NN}) based formalism that intuitively bridges the gap between {MIL} problem definition and the vast existing knowledge-base of standard models and classifiers. We show that the proposed {NN} formalism is effectively optimizable by a back-propagation algorithm and can reveal unknown patterns inside bags. Comparison to 14 types of classifiers from the prior art on a set of 20 publicly available benchmark datasets confirms the advantages and accuracy of the proposed solution.},

By contrast, the response of cortical circuits to sensory stimulation can be both multistable and graded1,2,3,4. We propose that the neocortex combines digital selection of an active set of neurons with analogue response by dynamically varying the positive feedback inherent in its recurrent connections. Strong positive feedback causes differential instabilities that drive the selection of a set of active neurons under the constraints embedded in the synaptic weights. Once selected, the active neurons generate weaker, stable feedback that provides analogue amplification of the input. Here we present our model of cortical processing as an electronic circuit that emulates this hybrid operation, and so is able to perform computations that are similar to stimulus selection, gain modulation and spatiotemporal pattern generation in the neocortex.},

We show that the L-{BFGS} method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-{BFGS} method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-{BFGS} method. However we find that for other problems the L-{BFGS} method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost.

	abstract = {Deep learning has led to significant advances in artificial intelligence, in part, by adopting strategies motivated by neurophysiology. However, it is unclear whether deep learning could occur in the real brain. Here, we show that a deep learning algorithm that utilizes multi-compartment neurons might help us to understand how the neocortex optimizes cost functions. Like neocortical pyramidal neurons, neurons in our model receive sensory information and higher-order feedback in electrotonically segregated compartments. Thanks to this segregation, neurons in different layers of the network can coordinate synaptic weight updates. As a result, the network learns to categorize images better than a single layer network. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm takes advantage of multilayer architectures to identify useful higher-order representations—the hallmark of deep learning. This work demonstrates that deep learning can be achieved using segregated dendritic compartments, which may help to explain the morphology of neocortical pyramidal neurons., Artificial intelligence has made major progress in recent years thanks to a technique known as deep learning, which works by mimicking the human brain. When computers employ deep learning, they learn by using networks made up of many layers of simulated neurons. Deep learning has opened the door to computers with human – or even super-human – levels of skill in recognizing images, processing speech and controlling vehicles. But many neuroscientists are skeptical about whether the brain itself performs deep learning., The patterns of activity that occur in computer networks during deep learning resemble those seen in human brains. But some features of deep learning seem incompatible with how the brain works. Moreover, neurons in artificial networks are much simpler than our own neurons. For instance, in the region of the brain responsible for thinking and planning, most neurons have complex tree-like shapes. Each cell has ‘roots’ deep inside the brain and ‘branches’ close to the surface. By contrast, simulated neurons have a uniform structure., To find out whether networks made up of more realistic simulated neurons could be used to make deep learning more biologically realistic, Guerguiev et al. designed artificial neurons with two compartments, similar to the ‘roots’ and ‘branches’. The network learned to recognize hand-written digits more easily when it had many layers than when it had only a few. This shows that artificial neurons more like those in the brain can enable deep learning. It even suggests that our own neurons may have evolved their shape to support this process., If confirmed, the link between neuronal shape and deep learning could help us develop better brain-computer interfaces. These allow people to use their brain activity to control devices such as artificial limbs. Despite advances in computing, we are still superior to computers when it comes to learning. Understanding how our own brains show deep learning could thus help us develop better, more human-like artificial intelligence in the future.},
